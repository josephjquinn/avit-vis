# Net-Vis

Net-Vis is an application designed for interactive visualization of performance metrics from machine learning models used in physics simulations. Built from scratch using React, TypeScript, and Python, this tool serves as a foundational component for machine learning research and can be extended for various applications.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: View and analyze performance metrics with dynamic charts and graphs.
- **NetCDF File Support**: Visualize complex fluid dynamics data for enhanced simulation analysis.
